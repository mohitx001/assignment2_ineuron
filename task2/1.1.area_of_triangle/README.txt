1.problem:
Write a Python Program(with class concepts) to find the area of the triangle using the below
formula.
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
Function to take the length of the sides of triangle from user should be defined in the parent
class and function to calculate the area should be defined in subclass.


2.output:

"C:\New folder\python38\python.exe" C:/Users/mjx/PycharmProjects/mjx/ineuron/assign2/task2/1.1.area_of_triangle/2.1.1.area_of_triangle.py
Area is
10.825317547305483

No of side is  3



Process finished with exit code 0
